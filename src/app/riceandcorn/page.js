            Joha rice is a short-grain aromatic rice variety that is native to
            the northeastern regions of India, especially Assam. It is also
            known as winter rice, Joha rice, or mi Joha.
            <strong>Joha rice is known for its sweet fragrance</strong>,
            delicate taste, and rich flavor. It has a sensitive texture and is
            high in antioxidants, fat, protein, amino acids, calcium, iron, and
            starch.
            <strong>
              Joha rice is also rich in bioactive compounds like omega-3 fatty
              acids, flavonoids, and phenolics, which may help lower blood
              sugar, protect against heart disease, and raise insulin levels.
              The short grained aromatic rice prevailing in the North eastern
              states of India, especially Assam, form a separate group of
              aromatic rice, called 'Joha' rice

            production, after wheat and rice. India is the fifth larg- est
            producer of maize in the world, contributing 3% of the global
