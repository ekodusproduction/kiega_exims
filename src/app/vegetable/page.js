                <strong>LONG BEAN</strong> is also known as the long-podded
                cowpea, asparagus bean, snake bean, or Chinese long bean. They
                have a very pronounced flavor and have a distinctly beany taste,
                and are not sweet like the green bean. Long beans work best
                briefly steamed, stir-fried, or braised, but also hold up well
                when added to stews.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conclusion, long beans are a nutritious and delicious vegetable
                that offer a wide range of health benefits. Whether you're looking
                to boost your immune system, improve your digestion, or fight
                inflammation, long beans are a great food to add to your diet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Organic long beans are considered as high-energy food and offer
                cardiovascular protection. They can be prepared into stir fries or
                even curry. The nutrition power pack of long beans are also
                important for the formation of healthy connective tissues and

                <strong>POINTED GOURD</strong> in English, Parwal is the Hindi
                name for the gourd and is also known by many other names including
                Parval in Nepali, Hindi, and Gujarati, Potol or Patol in Bengali,

                So here I am sharing the recipe with you all. Note: ( Lot of
                people get confused between tindora and parwal but both are
                slightly different vegetables. Parwal has a slightly tougher skin
                and pointed ends , while tindora has tender skin and slightly
                rounded ends.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Parwal is a powerhouse of essential nutrients. It contains
                significant amounts of vitamins A, B1, B2, and C, as well as
                minerals like magnesium, potassium, and iron. These nutrients are
                vital for maintaining overall health, boosting the immune system,

                <strong>LABLAB BEANS</strong>, also known as hyacinth beans or

              <p>
                <strong>Fresh pods:</strong> Can be eaten whole or processed into
                a meat substitute
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Plant:</strong> Can be used as livestock feed, green
                manure, an ornamental plant, or a medicinal herb.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lablab beans are rich in protein and other nutrients, and have a
                high lysine content similar to soy- beans. The beans also contain
                a relatively high amount of starch, but low fiber.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a significant feat, approximately 500 kg of lablab beans
                (urohi) were exported to the markets of London, England.
